You are the head of a low-income Mexican family. You have been working wihtout papers in the U.S. for some time now...
You have finally been able to save enough money to bring your kids with you. 

You go back to Mexico to pick them up, you have not seen them in 4 years, they've grown so much without you...
Your children have been living with your mom at Iguala, Guerrero (your hometown). 

The goal is to travel from Iguala to Los Angeles California (2003 miles), so you and your family can have a better life in "El Otro Lado."
You can only attempt to cross the border depending on how much money you have left, and how many times you have tried to cross and failed. 

The trip to the border is simple, but once you get there things get difficult.
Crossing the border successfully is the hardest part. 
You only have enough money for 3 attempts.

Things to watch:
- Money (most important)
- Family members energy (the lower the harder it is to cross and the higher risk of desease)
